## Description

The basic idea, on the one hand, is a web application where developers can register with their location; on the other hand, a mobile application in which developers / entrepreneurs can search for other developers working with such technology within a radius of 10 km

During the Omnistack 10.0 Week promoted by Rocketseat, we created a web application in addition to a mobile application. The communication between the two was made through a REST API also developed throughout the week.
